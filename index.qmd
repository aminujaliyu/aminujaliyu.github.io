# Welcome to My Personal Website

My name is **Aminu Jibrin Aliyu**, and I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer dedicated to advancing power systems stability, renewable energy integration, and advanced control strategies. My work focuses on developing innovative solutions to enhance energy efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in modern power systems.  

This website serves as a platform to showcase my research, publications, and professional journeyâ€”from my academic background in Electrical Engineering to my ongoing PhD research at **Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS**. My expertise spans **power electronics, grid-forming inverters, and MATLAB simulations**, with a strong emphasis on bridging the gap between academia and industry.  

Beyond research, I am actively involved in **mentorship and knowledge sharing**, serving as a **University and College Liaison Officer** at the **Zeribe Nwosu Foundation (ZNF)** and a **Newsletter Editor** for the **IEEE Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS Student Branch**. Through these roles, I contribute to educational initiatives, career mentorship, and the dissemination of technical knowledge.  

I invite you to explore my projects, publications, and professional engagements to learn more about my commitment to driving innovation in electrical and power engineering.
